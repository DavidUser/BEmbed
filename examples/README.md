# Examples
This examples is based on the Arduino Project examples, using zeus library insted.

In this phase of project the examples are not functional but just stubs of what we want to use. Feeling free and propose what you expect of one library to develop for all embeeded platforms.This is by low level features (digital/agalog IO) to high level (file systems, email, chat, graphics, etc).
