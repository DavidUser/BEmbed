# Zeus Library
Proposal of elegant unique development for all microcontrollers.

It's a library to developing easily and with a high level of customization, to you have the best performace and best productivity. So what we are doing is empower you to have great results.

## Currently
Do library work nouveau, just output print reports.

## Language
This library will be written with C++ language possibly with most recently standards (C++03, C++11, C++14). Forks to other languages are welcome.

## Plan
	* Do library work nouveau
	* Do library work with Arduino Layer
	* Do library work with AVR controller
	* Do library work with MSP controller
	* Library refatoring on all platforms
	* Diagrams checking and update
	* Documentation
	* Implement peripherals layer (no-platform dependent)
	* Diagrams checking and update
	* Documentation
	* Design boards to AVR
	* Design boards to MSP
	* Design boards with multiple controllers
	* Design peripheral boards
	* Redesign all boards
